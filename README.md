This is a repository for some comun assignments of numerical methods written in Java

If you are reading this is because I need to say something to you:

The majority of these programs have been created when I didn't have good programming practices. So, having that in mind, maybe some programs will not have the best programming practices. But hey, I would like to improve that ;) 

Anyways, I will add documentation and commentaries in english someday. for now... sorry :c 
		
Hope you have a great day - MortisBlack
